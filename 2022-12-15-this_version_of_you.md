# intro

What is meaning of my existence? What is my purpose? Why is this life worth living? These sorts of a existential questions can inspire a lot of fear and often these questions can go unanswered and feel like unbearable.

I have found myself obsessing about the delta between where I am, and where I think I want to be. Sometimes even questioning my motives. Is journey of life worth the duress?

If you think about these things too, I'd like to share my experience with you such that it may change your perspective on how to cope with these large and intrusive thoughts. And as a disclaimer, I am not perfect, but I've found some peace, and I hope to share it with you too.

# accepting where you are
One of the hardest parts of starting this journey is to understand that where you are is exactly where you should be. And when I say where you should be, it's not really a matter of deserving to be there, but rather, it's simply where you are in your journey. There's no judgment about that place and there's no judgment about your character, it's simply a validation about your lived experience  -- how far you've come, and how far you have to go. I think radically accepting this moment can become one of the most freeing ways to escape the weight of the judgments we place upon ourselves. It is so easy to say, "I should be different", "I should be in a different place",  or "I shouldn't have these problems." However, I find this sort of dialogue unhelpful because it invalidates oneself and doesn't offer any room for compassion. I think it's much harder to practice patience and self compassion in these moments of accusation and discontent. For context, there was a point in my life, where I lost most of my executive function. Some incredibly traumatic events had occurred, which caused me to spiral into a profound depressive state. One of the things that I remember chanting over and over were phrases such as "I don't want to be like this", "I don't want to be having this problem", "why do I have this disorder", "I wish I was different". And after reciting this over and over, it got to a point where I felt like there was no escape. I had convinced myself that this trauma was permanent. I had fostered a sense of self hatred, because accepting who I was in that moment, felt like I would be betraying my core values, the very values that had led me to extraordinary places and had motivated me to achieved incredible accomplishments. I held onto a belief that it was paramount to be exemplary, and that anything less would be unforgivable. I think this perspective caused a lot of my thinking to be fixed on a binary scale, either I was performing or I was a complete degenerate. However with time I was able to accept that perhaps it's a scale, it's progressive, and it's sort of arbitrary. Every day is a different day and we are such complicated creatures, living in such a complicated world, that to reduce our perceptions of self to a binary evaluation unfairly places a burden upon us to control that which is uncontrollable. My advice would be accept yourself, accept where you are, and accept that your espoused version of yourself may not be who you are in this moment, but that's OK. There's so much time to grow, there's so much time to evolve, and there's so much time to forgive yourself for not being perfect.

# incremental progress
I think a common misconception that can lead to a lot of that self judgment, misery, and that feeling of being trapped, is this idea of I need to juggle everything or handle every situation perfectly. There were times during that depressive episode where I would look around my apartment and see a pile of laundry, a pile of dishes, dirty cat litter, and clutter counters. I would get so down on myself, saying, "how would I get my life together, how could I feel better, if I don't even willpower to do the dishes". And just like with our previous concept of acceptance, I think it's really important to identify the small wins that occur because not only does it give a sense of progress, but also can give a sense of mastery as those wins accumulate. So, for example, maybe I didn't do the dishes today, but maybe I was able to put all of my laundry in the bin. In my eyes, that's a win. Maybe tomorrow, I'll be able to do a little bit more, or maybe not. I think it's possible to extend this idea to more meta concepts. So, for example, let's say I just heard some really bad news and I felt really overwhelmed by it, leading to a desire to escape the feeling of sadness. No matter how I handle that desire to escape (effective or not), I think there's a win there -- identifying the response, that thought of "I need to escape this feeling". Even if I responded by defaulting to some sort of problematic behavior in order to cope -- I don't need to be proud of that behavior, but I don't need to judge myself for defaulting to it either. Maybe next time I'll have the wisdom to do something different. 

I think there's great power in incremental progress and developing a sense of mastery as one learns to identify how they respond to all of the things that occur in one's life, stressful and pleasant.

# gratitude
As I've progressed down the path of self mastery, I found that it is still easy to get caught in this desire to be the espoused version of oneself. Leaning slightly on the previous idea of incremental progress, I think gratitude can play a huge role in shifting one's mindset. In the previous example about laundry, the concept of gratitude that I want to share can be expressed by the idea that, "I am grateful that I can do this myself. Perhaps last week, I couldn't get out of bed, but this week I can make my home a little better." I think this idea helps cultivate a sense of hope that things can change. I think it also builds compassion, and perhaps it also reinforces a regular practice of acceptance. Life could be wonderful or life could be disparaging, but seldom do I believe that there is nothing to be grateful for. And I want to be clear, I don't mean gratitude in the sense of sitting at the table during Thanksgiving, and sharing the top three things you're grateful for like a dog or a cat or your fish, but rather gratitude that you've made it another step in your journey, and that you've made it one more day in this incredibly challenging world we live in. 

No one has ever asked for the burdens inherent to being conscious, but perhaps we may celebrate life by practicing the gift of gratitude.

# conclusion
I've projected a lot here on how you might be feeling, and I get it if this isn't for you. Maybe your experience is different. If it is, please share it below. I think there's a lot of potential for healing in sharing one's experience. Thank you listening, thank you for attention, and I wish you luck on the journey.
